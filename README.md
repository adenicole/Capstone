## Project details

This project was created to show the use of a CI/CD pipeline to create a simple app written in python to show 'Hello world...' message when receiving request.
Docker images were pushed to Docker hub, Hadolint was installed to lint the dockerfile, connect to the kubernetes cluster and deployed the docker image to it using rolling deployment.

Project steps:

- Create Makefile
- Create Dockerfile and Lint Dockerfile
- Build Docker image by running `./run_docker.sh` (make it executabe first by `chmod +x run_docker.sh`)
- Push to Docker hub using `./upload_docker.sh` (make it executabe first by `chmod +x upload_docker`)
- Install kubectl
- Create Kubernetes configuration file
- deploy app to AWS EKS cluster
- Create CI/CD to run this commands after testing locally on your system or server.


## Tools used

- Circleci for implementing the CI/CD
- GitHub for versioning
- AWS as the Cloud service
- Kubernetes to create clusters
- Docker containers deployed to the k8 clusters
- aws cli
